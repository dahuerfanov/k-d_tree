## k-dimensional tree

In this task, you will implement a nearest-neighbour search in euclidean space using a k-d tree.

1. Implement the remaining part of the nearestPointInSubtree function (see instructions in the code).
2. Create a simple project based on main.cpp that features some kind of a build config (make or cmake, Linux environment).
